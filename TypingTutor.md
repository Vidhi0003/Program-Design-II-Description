Project 3: Typing Tutor

This program was created to give users the option to spell commonly mispelled words, display some words from a data set, practice typing random words from a dictionary, or to search for a word in the dictionary. This program was created to help discover string comparison, reading and accessing data from files and implementing an algorithm, which in this case is, binary search.

There were 3 files that were provided:

1)  program3.cc : This contained starter code and all my work
2)  dictionary.txt : This holds a list of words that are sorted in alphabetical order. The format
 for the data is one word on each line.
3)   misspelled.txt : This file has a list of word pairs, the misspelled version of the word and the cor
rectly spelled version of the word. The format is one pair per line, with the misspelled
 word first (then a space) followed by the correctly spelled version of that word.
