Project 3: Typing Tutor

This program was created to give users the option to spell commonly mispelled words, display some words from a data set, practice typing random words from a dictionary, or to search for a word in the dictionary. This program was created to help discover string comparison, reading and accessing data from files and implementing an algorithm, which in this case is, binary search. I had to do this project individually and I was able to learn a lot about accessing information from different files.

There were 3 files that were provided:

1)  program3.cc : This contained starter code and all my work
2)  dictionary.txt : This holds a list of words that are sorted in alphabetical order. The format for the data is one word on each line.
3)   misspelled.txt : This file has a list of word pairs, the misspelled version of the word and the correctly spelled version of the word. The format is one pair per line, with the misspelled word first (then a space) followed by the correctly spelled version of that word.

The starter code was provided by George Maratos and David Hayes
