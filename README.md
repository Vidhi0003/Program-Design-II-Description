# CS141 Class Description

This was the first class I had taken in C++. In this class, I obtained many skills that would help me become a better programmer in the future. Here are some of the things I learned:

1) Basic Syntax and Data Types: One of the first things I learned in class was various different data types, operators, and basic inputs/outputs which enabled me to write simple yet effective programs. While the professor was teaching the class different data types, he emphazised the importance of indentation and keywords as these are integral to becoming a good programmer. I also learned binary operations and their applications in programming, including bit manipulation.

2) Control Structures: I developed programs that utilized conditional statements and loops. This helped me understand the use of for, while, and do-while loops, including the functionalities of break and continue. This experience helped me grasp flow control and decision-making processes within code.

3) Functions and Modularity: These projects focused on creating modular code through functions. I learned how to define and call functions, enhancing code readability and reusability. This taught me how to break programs into smaller, manageable pieces to enhance clarity and reusability. I studied the concept of variable scope and its implications in programming. I also learned the differences between passing arguments by value and by reference, including their effects on data.

4) Data Structures: I implemented projects that manipulated arrays, vectors and strings, allowing me to understand data storage and string handling in C++. This was crucial for managing collections of data. While learning about arrays, I learned about issues related to arrays, such as out-of-bounds access and memory allocation as well as how 2D arrays work for matrix-like data structures.

5) File Handling:  I learned how to read from and write to files, expanding my ability to handle data beyond the console. This emphasized the significance of persistent data storage in programming.

6) Searching and Sorting: As one of our projects was about searching through data, I was introduced to efficient searching algorithms like binary search and how they would be implemented. The professor went over various sorting algorithms, including selection sort and bubble sort.

7) Object-Oriented Programming: We also touched upon object-oriented programming through classes, structs, constructors, destructors and operator overloading.

8) Recursion: I gained a foundational understanding of recursive functions and their use cases. In particular, we went over a maze problem that used both iterative and recursive methods, illustrating practical applications of recursion.

9) Linked Lists: One of the last things we went over in this class was linked lists. I learned about linked lists as dynamic data structures that allow for flexible memory use. This helped me gain an understanding of how to append, delete, and insert nodes in order as well as explore recursively reversing a linked list. As we went over this, the professor also went over doubly linked lists and I studied stack data structures using linked lists, which helped me understand push and pop operations. We also touched upon some important features such as auto type deduction, static variables, and optional arguments to enhance coding efficiency.

# CS141 Projects

In my CS141 course, I embarked on a journey into the world of C++ programming, laying a solid foundation for my skills. Each project challenged me to apply fundamental concepts and deepen my understanding of programming principles. I have the descriptions of each project in a folder. Here’s a list of some of the projects I have completed:

1) Project 1: ASCII Flowers
2) Project 2: Great13
3) Project 3: Typing Tutor

Each of these projects played a vital role in my development as a programmer and set the stage for more advanced concepts in C++. I am excited to continue building on this foundation in future coursework.
